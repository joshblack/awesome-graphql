## Community 

- Jason Dusek (solidsnack) dove deep into PostgreSQL to teach it how to respond to GraphQL query strings as though they were SQL queries. Check out [GraphpostgresQL](https://github.com/solidsnack/GraphpostgresQL)*
- Espen Hovlandsdal (rexxars) built a [sql-to-graphql](https://github.com/vaffel/sql-to-graphql) tool that can perform introspection on the tables of a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and produce a queryable HTTP GraphQL endpoint out of it*
- Mick Hansen (mickhansen) offers a set of [schema-building](https://github.com/mickhansen/graphql-sequelize) helpers for use with the Sequelize ORM for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL*
- Bryan Goldstein (brysgo) has built a tool to help you define a GraphQL schema that wraps a set of Bookshelf.JS models. Check out [graphql-bookshelf](https://github.com/brysgo/graphql-bookshelf)*
- RisingStack (risingstack) created a GraphQL ORM called [graffiti](https://github.com/RisingStack/graffiti) that you can plug into mongoose and serve using Express, Hapi, or Koa*
- David Mongeau-Petitpas (dmongeau) is working on a way to vend your Laravel models through a GraphQL endpoint, [laravel-graphql](https://github.com/Folkloreatelier/laravel-graphql)*
- Gerald Monaco (devknoll) created [graphql-schema](https://github.com/devknoll/graphql-schema) to allow the creation of JavaScript GraphQL schemas using a fluent/chainable interface*
- Adam Pietrasiak created [typegql](https://github.com/prismake/typegql) that can be used to create advanced graphql schema with plain javascript classes and decorators
